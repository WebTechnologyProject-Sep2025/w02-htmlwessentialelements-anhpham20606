    <h2>Aims</h2>
    <p>This project-based unit focuses on developing your skills to build web applications
        using web technologies. You'll work individually and in teams to tackle real-world
        web development challenges, building proficiency in selecting and applying suitable
        tools and techniques. The unit also covers essential aspects of security, ethics,
        accessibility, and professional communication within web development. Guidance
        from an academic facilitator will support you in mastering both technical skills and
        collaborative project management techniques to achieve these objectives.</p>
